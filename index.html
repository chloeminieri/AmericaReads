            <br><p class = "homepage">America Reads Tutoring Corps is a program that is focused on improving children's literacy skills. Through working with University of Michigan Students as tutors, Ann Arbor children are able to develop their reading and writing skills along with forming encouraging relationships with their tutors. The Edward Ginsberg Center for Community Service and Learning is the foundation of this program, and it has existed since 1997.  </p>

                <div class = "sem"> <b>Fall Term</b> <br><br> <div style="text-align:left;">The fall semester at the University of Michigan commonly occurs from late August to mid December. Within this semester, there are a few holidays where the tutors do not attend their sessions with tutees. These holidays include Labor Day and Thanksgiving, where the students do not have classes.</div></div>
                <div class = "sem"> <b>Winter Term</b> <br><br> <div style="text-align:left;">The winter semester occurs from early January to late April, with exams until May 1. In the winter semester, there are also a couple holidays where students do not tutor.

            <br><p class = "homepage">America Reads works with thousands of children within the Washtenaw and Wayne counties. This program helps over 500 elementary school students every year.</p>
            <p class = "homepage">Working with elementary school students, America Reads was always an in-person tutoring experience. However, with the current pandemic, the program has shifted to an online format in which tutoring is held through Zoom. The virtual tutoring role that many University of Michigan students currently have is a 45 minute to 60 minute session. </p><br>

Each lesson, one tutor is focusing on any technical difficulties while the other is completing the lesson plan with the tutee.  </div>
