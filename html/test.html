        <p id = "summary"> As a tutor for America Reads, there are two ways to join. If, as a student, you are able to receive Work Study then tutoring is a job that can help pay for your education. If you are not eligible for work study, then you can join America Reads as a volunteer. </p>

                <p class = "mem_title">Federal Work Study</p> <br> Federal Work Study is a financial aid program. This program supports students through allowing them to get part-time jobs and earn money to pay for their education. A percentage of the earnings is paid by federal funds, while the rest is paid by the employer of the student. In order to be eligible for Work Study, you have to apply for financial aid.

                <p class = "mem_title">Volunteering</p> <br> America Reads welcomes all students, even if they are not eligible for financial aid. Because of this, students can join as volunteers and provide their time generously in order to help students in grades K-3. The overall goal is to help students read independently before reaching the third grade, and the University of Michigan encourages all of their students to help!
